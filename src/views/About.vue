                    To make things clear, <span class="white">the pity displayed is not your probability, but your
                    progress toward the pity</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you have <span class="orange">{{ toNumber(0.75) }}</span> as pity, it doesn't mean
                    that you have <span class="orange">75%</span> chances to get your pity at the next pull, but rather
                    that you need still <span class="yellow">25%</span> to get to the pity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words:
                    <span class="white">The pity displayed here is linear, the probabilities aren't.</span>
