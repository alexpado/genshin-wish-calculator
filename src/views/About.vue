                    To make things clear, <span class="white">the pity displayed is not your probability, but your
                    progress toward the pity</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you have <span class="orange">{{ toNumber(0.75) }}</span> as pity, it doesn't mean
                    that you have <span class="orange">75%</span> chances to get your pity at the next pull, but rather
                    that you need still <span class="orange">25%</span> to get to the pity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words:
                    <span class="white">The pity displayed here is linear, the probabilities aren't.</span>

                <p>
                    The starglitters amount obtained from pulling is approximate: while pulling, you can obtain 4*
                    characters and weapons, but there is a catch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To have a precise number, it would have been necessary to input <span class="white">every</span>
                    characters you have with their constellations and a lot of probabilities calculation would need to
                    be done. It's getting even worse when it comes to the weapon banner. You can refer to the reddit
                    post
                    linked in the "About the pity" section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you may guess, it would add more work on both side (and unfortunately, I'm a little bit lazy),
                    and this tool is meant to help you quickly see if you need to save a lot of primogems or buy packs,
                    not to be precise.

                <p>
                    <span class="orange">For the character banner:</span> For the minimum amount, it is assumed that
                    each 4* and 5* pulls are a duplicated character (without reaching the maximum constellation, for the
                    same reason as above). For the maximum amount, it is assumed that each 4* and 5* pulls are a
                    duplicated character at max constellation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="orange">For the weapon banner:</span> There is almost no differences with the character
                    banner. Everything is done in a similar way, but as min and max values are the same, results are
                    displayed only once.
